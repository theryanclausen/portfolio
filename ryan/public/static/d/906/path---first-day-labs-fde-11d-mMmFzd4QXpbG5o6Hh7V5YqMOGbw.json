{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>My first day of labs was interesting. I was not expecting to be bumped from my chosen group, but sometimes that's the way the cookie crumbles. 'When is My Kid on Stage' was the name of the project we were given. None of us really liked that name and from the wireframes we could not really glean the intended functionality of the app. So we made some adjustments.    </p>\n<p>Why limit the app to the stage? Kids have all sorts of hobbies that take place all over town. Parents have places to be, too. It's hard to keep tabs on everyone. So we came up with a new name 'Family Tabs.' It's the best way to keep tabs on the whole family.</p>\n<p>Our group is made up of members from different cohorts. As a result, we are all different distances in time from slight variations on the curriculum. Getting everyone on the same page from a technical stand point may pose a challenge in these early days. We chose a tech stack that was a mix of familiar and new concepts and did our best to defend them. Unfortunately, we did not realize that when our documentation asked for costs and benefits, it was not referring to monetary value. No approval today. </p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/first-day-labs","title":"First Day of Labs 9","author":"Ryan Clausen","date":"January 7th, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{}}
