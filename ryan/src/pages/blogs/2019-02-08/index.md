###Individual Accomplishments

[Github contribution graph.](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pulse)

So we have come to the end of labs. We now have a functioning application. There is so much I accomplished and so much more I wanted to accomplish. I had a lot of refactoring and cleaning up to do this week that slowed me down. I got about four hours of sleep a night trying to get ahead. It has been a really frustrating five weeks for me, but it's over now. We have an app. It's done.
