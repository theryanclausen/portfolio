###Individual Accomplishments

[Github contribution graph.](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pulse)

More late nights. More hard work. I built out the functionality on the household and notifications pages and continued my work with the calendar. Events are now stored in the global state with their approval status if created by a child account. The notification and calendar components both filter and display this data differently.

###Milestone Reflections      
  ***Bugs***
  
 * Create event and family member modals are ugly.
 * Create select inputs don't retain created data as selected. 
 * Can't edit events.
 * Calendar has some weird responses to picking prior dates.
