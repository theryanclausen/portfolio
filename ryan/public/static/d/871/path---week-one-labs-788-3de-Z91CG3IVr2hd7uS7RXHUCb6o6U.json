{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>Individual Accomplishments</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pulse\">Github contribution graph.</a></p>\n<p>This week we set up our relational database. I had a lot to do with the implementation and execution of that task. We also layed out the skeleton for our front end with a navigation bar to connect the various components. I used my whiteboard a lot to visualize the data and MS Paint to share my ideas with the group. We have a live zoom open all day and utilize a lot of pair programming. I was able to share my knowledge with the group and give them refreshers on some aspects of both front end and back end that they haven't worked with in a while. </p>\n<h3>Proof of Progress</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pull/18\">Github Front end Commit #1: The Skeleton</a> -\n<a href=\"https://trello.com/c/9fL2S4nc/27-front-end-skeleton\">Corresponding Trello</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pull/15\">Github Front end Commit #2: The Reset</a> -\n<a href=\"https://trello.com/c/a1MdGMQ4/29-base-level-styling\">Corresponding Trello</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pull/18\">Github Back end Commit #1: The Database</a> -\n<a href=\"https://trello.com/c/I8NOr9am/24-database\">Corresponding Trello</a><br>\n<strong><em><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/PyOE5UP\">Screenshot album with reflections</a></em></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pull/14\">Github Back end Commit #2: The Calendar Endpoint</a> -\n<a href=\"https://trello.com/c/cRf3fmgA/30-calendar-pull-endpoint\">Corresponding Trello</a></p>\n<h3>Milestone Reflections</h3>\n<p><strong><em>How the team came together.</em></strong></p>\n<p>I was bumped from the team I had signed up for. That group contained a few developers I knew and who's work I had seen. I was thrown into a team of unknown entities on a project that wasn't the least bit appealing to me. I thought I was screwed. I thought the my time at Lambda would culminate in a project I couldn't be proud of due to a random roll-of-the-dice intended to make things fair for everyone except me.</p>\n<p>Then I got over it. I spoke to the team, and it turns out nobody was a fan of the original idea. So we changed it. It took a little back and forth with administration, but everybody contributed to our new concept and by picking our battles, we were able to come to a compromise we could work with.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Planting Seeds.</em></strong></p>\n<p>When it came down to getting to the actual work, it became apparent that I was the most comfortable creating web applications. The rest of the team had been off in Computer Science or working as a full time Project Manager/Student Lead. </p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/week-one-labs","title":"Labs 9 Week One Wrap up","author":"Ryan Clausen","date":"Jan 11 2019","cover_image":null}}},"pageContext":{}}
