{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pulse\">Github contribution graph.</a></p>\n<p>This week we set up our relational database. I had a lot to do with the implementation and execution of that task. We also layed out the skeleton for our front end with a navigation bar to connect the various components. I used my whiteboard a lot to visualize the data and MS Paint to share my ideas with the group. We have a live zoom open all day and utilize a lot of pair programming. I was able to share my knowledge with the group and give them refreshers on some aspects of both front end and back end that they haven't worked with in a while. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pull/18\">Github Front end Commit #1: The Skeleton</a> -\n<a href=\"https://trello.com/c/9fL2S4nc/27-front-end-skeleton\">Corresponding Trello</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pull/15\">Github Front end Commit #2: The Reset</a> -\n<a href=\"https://trello.com/c/a1MdGMQ4/29-base-level-styling\">Corresponding Trello</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pull/18\">Github Back end Commit #1: The Database</a> -\n<a href=\"https://trello.com/c/I8NOr9am/24-database\">Corresponding Trello</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/PyOE5UP\">Deep dive imgur gallery</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pull/14\">Github Back end Commit #2: The Calendar Endpoint</a> -\n<a href=\"https://trello.com/c/cRf3fmgA/30-calendar-pull-endpoint\">Corresponding Trello</a></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/week-one-labs","title":"Labs 9 Week One Wrap up","author":"Ryan Clausen","date":"Jan 11 2019","cover_image":null}}},"pageContext":{}}
