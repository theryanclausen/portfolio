{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>Individual Accomplishments</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pulse\">Github contribution graph.</a></p>\n<p>This week we set up our relational database. I had a lot to do with the implementation and execution of that task. We also layed out the skeleton for our front end with a navigation bar to connect the various components. I used my whiteboard a lot to visualize the data and MS Paint to share my ideas with the group. We have a live zoom open all day and utilize a lot of pair programming. I was able to share my knowledge with the group and give them refreshers on some aspects of both front end and back end that they haven't worked with in a while. </p>\n<h3>Proof of Progress</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pull/28\">Github Front end Commit #1: Setting Up the Auth0</a> -\n<a href=\"https://trello.com/c/CQHtXIAn/32-auth0-connect-front-end\">Corresponding Trello</a>  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pull/51\">Github Front end Commit #2: Dev Backdoor to bypass database interaction</a> -\n<a href=\"https://trello.com/c/06CruH98/38-backdoor-for-dev-to-bypass-database\">Corresponding Trello</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-family-tabs/pull/42\">Github Back end Commit #1: Connected the Auth login to user/family data on the back end</a> -\n<a href=\"https://trello.com/c/5mjMqHGU/22-auth0-security\">Corresponding Trello</a> </p>\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"#\">Screenshot album with reflections</a></em></strong></p>\n<h3>Milestone Reflections</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Setting up the Auth0</em></strong></p>\n<p>Auth0 was a real adventure. I thought using a third party security system would mean less work on my end, but as it turns out, you can only do so much to abstract away security before it stops being secure. I spent the weekend spinning up a little sandbox auth project. I had intended to spend only a few hours, but I was unprepared for the layers of complexity.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Laying the foundation.</em></strong></p>\n<p>When it came down to getting to the actual work, it became apparent that I was the most comfortable creating web applications. The rest of the team had been off in Computer Science or working as a full time Project Manager/Student Lead. I am fresh out of Fullstack. As a result, I have taken on the role of the catch all problem solver.</p>\n<p>By utilizing a persistent zoom channel and a focus on pair and mob programming, I am not only able to insure that we don't get stuck on a simple problem, I am able to refresh my team on concepts that they haven't touched in months. We take turns on the keyboard and we pause for questions. By defining the issue and overviewing my best solution, I am empowering the rest of the team to be more independent in future weeks.</p>\n<p>One thing I am concerned about is letting production bottleneck at me. I want everyone to be able to contribute equally. I can only hope that in taking the point on bringing the team back up to speed and taking on a little extra work hasn't rubbed anybody the wrong way. </p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/week-two-labs","title":"Labs 9 Week Two Wrap up","author":"Ryan Clausen","date":"Jan 17 2019"}}},"pageContext":{}}
