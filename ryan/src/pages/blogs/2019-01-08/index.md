Last night was a late night. Our TDD rejection came in waves. A few hours after labs time ended, we were hit with additional requirements. This happened to be about the time I was doing my nightly Project Manager duties as a PM for the WebPT4 group. I did my best to address some of the more pressing issues after part time was over. Four hours of researching competing technologies and I called it a night. 

We met early morning to discuss additional changes to the wire frame that would have to be made. I busted out my MS paint skills and made an ugly mock up of a missing page. With that and the submission of our updated TDD, we were back in hurry up and wait mode. 

We did what we could to maximize our time. We built a Trello board from scratch, not knowing we would be provided one in the afternoon. We started talking about our relational database design. It took us a few iterations to figure out a rough data flow that will probably be expanded and updated as time goes on. Knowing the nature of RDMS, it's usually better to over organize than under organize. Here is another work of MS Paint art I concocted just before I had the epiphany that we'd probably want to allow for more than one family to sign up. 

Nobody in the group is that fond of Redux, so I pushed for the use of the React Context Api for global state management. I prepared a small example to show the group so we can all get on the same page with our data.
